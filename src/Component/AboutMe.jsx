              My programming journey began in 2024. I started out curious and a
              bit lost, watching tutorials and searching online without a clear
              direction. Later that year, I joined the Programming Hero
              Bootcamp, which gave me the structure and motivation I needed.
              Though I faced many errors and challenges, I never gave up. Day by
              day, I grew more confident and skilled, learning the full MERN
              stack and building real projects.

              Outside of coding, Iâ€™m a big cricket fan and love playing whenever
              I get time. I also enjoy writing poetry in my free time. Poetry
              allows me to express my thoughts and emotions in a creative way
              beyond just coding. These hobbies keep me balanced, refreshed, and
              inspired to keep learning and creating.
